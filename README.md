This project is a Discord bot which helps a user in doing competitive programming efficiently.
This project aims to replace all the existent bots which are malfunctioning due to changes in their hosting clients, and also add [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) as one of the judges supported, which none of the other existent bots supported.

We started off by figuring out the API requirements, thus ended up using APIs provided by [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp), [Kenkoooo](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table/)
and [Clist](https://clist.by/). Next, we worked on the database to be used for the project, and finally used Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
Finally, we created various functions that would enhance a user's experience on competitive programming platforms using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and used [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for web scrapping. Lastly, all this was integrated using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Features

1. **Competitive Programming Judges supported**: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
2. **Handle Identification**: Identifies handles of a user on the said judges, one user can have atmost one ID registered with the bot for a particular judge.
3. **Problem Recommendation**: Recommend random problem which the **user hasn't solved**, satisfying the conditions given by the user in the command
4. **Points and Leaderboard**: Provides points for problems recommended by the bot which the user solves and maintains leaderboards for the same
5. **Duels**: One user can challenge another user using this feature for a competitive programming duel
6. **Next Contests**: Provides a list of next ten contests in the future
7. **Stalk**: One user can stalk any other user on the judge using this feature, which provides the problems solved by that user and their rating
8. **Rating Change**: Provides the rating changes and results of a specific contest queried
9. **Graphs**: Provides graphs pertaining to various features such as performance, problems solved over time and ratings of problems solved over time
10. **Chat**: Enables chatting with bot using Google-Gemini AI model.

The commands for all these features and their usage can be retrieved by executing the command ```;help``` in the server.

# Making the env file

The process.env file used in the bot:

![process.env](https://github.com/Sparsh752/TLE_Python/assets/95131287/177d8c6c-4b8a-4b0c-967a-2c0550c2fed4)

**TOKEN**: Each bot, upon its creation, is given a `token` by Discord which is used by `discord.py` in running the bot. <br>
**GUILD**: It is the `id` of the `channel` one wants the bot to run on. <br>
**CLIST_TOKEN**: It is the token that is required for making a `clist api` call, it can be availed by making an account on [clist.by](https://clist.by/)
**GOOGLE_API**: It is the token that is required for making a `google-gemini api` call, it can be availed by making an account on [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand_core_brand&gad_source=1)
